    "1. There are inconsistencies in the street naming, especially in the abbreviation and missing street type. (eg: Taman Sari instead of Jalan Taman Sari)\n",

    "2. There are missing user and userID that unables to import the data into csv while adhering to the schema. \n",

    "### Inconsistent Street Naming\n",
    "A little background, unlike the U.S, Indonesia does not have street types like Avenue, Road or Street. In Indonesia, all the roads or streets or avenues is called \"Jalan\" which basically means pathway\" and encompasses all different types of street. After running the audit-streetname.py and checking for \"Jalan\", I discover that there are a lot of streets that is missing this description (such as as well as incosistent abbreviation use like \"JL\", \"Jl.\", \"Jl\", etc.\n",

    "To update the street name, I used a similar code with the case study that utiilzes regular expressions in order to check the first word of the street name and map the correct format (eg: from 'Jl.' to 'Jalan') or add 'Jalan' to the street name if it is missing in the first place.\n",

    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I got this result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "Bandung|711\n",
    "Bandung, Jawa Barat|189\n",
    "Bandung Barat|130\n",
    "bandung|16\n",
    "Cimahi|9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 4 cities are Bandung, but inputted in different variations that makes the count wrong because all of the nodes are actually referring to the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, when I was running keys.py to list all the keys available, I realized that there are a lot of None values in the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this problem can be removed by providing a guideline in the form of some kind of visualization of what keys and what values you can input. This way, when a user wants to update or input a new node, he or she can just look at this guideline and choose what key name to use and value to input along with the key name so that the new node/way is consistent with the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that something similar like this exists already: https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org\n",
    "but this is still too broad as it encompasses the whole OpenStreetMap. Maybe something that is more specific such as only limititing it to the cities in MapZen will be more practical and useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the challenge itself is to create such documentation when the whole thing right now is already messy and inconsistent. Before starting the documentation, someone has to tidy up the current existing data and then create a proper documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or another thing that can be done is to create an automated program that tries to match a new key or value inputted to an existing one. If no match is one, this program will then generate request and wait for admin approval before the new key or value is added. But the problem with this is, it will require someone or a group of people that act as admin and monitor every single request that does not match with an existing one which will be quite time consuming considering the large amount of user contribution to OSM Project every day.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "From wrangling the Bandung OSM, I realize that there is a lot of variations in the data input and there still a lot of cleaning to be done, especially to ensure the validity and consistency of the data set. Also, I found out that there is some error that results in unexisting user and uid for some of the nodes and ways, which can be prevented if a rule that requires user and uid to create nodes/ways is enforced. This is definitely an interesting project that allows me to know more about one of my favorite cities in Indonesia!"
